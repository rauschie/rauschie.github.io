## Type constuctors -- Abstracting over (side-)effects
We've shown how expressing our programs in terms of pure functions is extremely beneficial for composability and correctness, however, we are asking a <i>lot</i> of today's programs. They have to operate over networks, across multiple processors, often on spotty data and can have ridiculously complex dependencies. At this point it is still unclear, how pure functions can encode such computational contexts.
In this chapter, we are introducing an essential construct that can be used to abstract away the most common effects, that obfuscate variables. Some of those are: not being readily available or available at all, needing external dependencies or needing a plan B if things go seriously wrong (throwing `Exception`s). 

### An intro: the "Maybe" type

Given

$\mathbb{A}:$ any type expressible by the type system

you can define:

$Maybe(\mathbb{A}) := \mathbb{A}\bigsqcup()$

--  where $()$ denotes the empty set. We aren't picking the empty set because it's empty, but because it is agreed that every set contains it. It serves as the bottom type, a type that is a subtype of all other types. 
 You might ask what's in the empty set and your answer is right: nothing. Types like `never`, `Nothing` or `null` can be used to encode exactly that notion. A value of type $Maybe(\mathbb{A})$ is then either an $\mathbb{A}$ or nothing.

## Monads -- encoding the notion: "And $then$"

The type $Maybe$, together with two operations defined over it is an example of a monad.
The monad is a construct that lets us encapsulate some side effect and takes the form of some type constructor $M()$. We'll call the first associated operation '$then$'.

$\cdot \mathbin{then} \cdot: (Maybe(\mathbb{A}), \mathbb{A} \Rightarrow Maybe(\mathbb{B}))\Rightarrow Maybe(\mathbb{B})$

The notation is a bit tense at first but what this operator does is allowing you to chain any number of functions together that return a $Maybe$.

given:  

$getUserByEmail: \mathbb{String} \Rightarrow Maybe(\mathbb{User})$
$getActiveSessionByUser: \mathbb{U}ser \Rightarrow Maybe(\mathbb{S}ession)$  
$getCartContentBySession: \mathbb{S}ession \Rightarrow Maybe(\mathbb{C}artItems)$

you can define:  

$getCartContentByEmail: \mathbb{S}tring \Rightarrow Maybe(\mathbb{C}artItems)$  
$= getUserByEmail \mathbin{then} (getActiveSessionByUser \mathbin{then} (getCartContentBySession))$

the operator $then$ runs by a number of aliases, including `flatMap`, `pipe`, `>>=`, the latter pronounced as "\[monadic\] bind"

Let's stop and ponder for a second on what we just did here.


### Monad laws

#### Left- and right identity
#### Associativity

### List -- I don't care, how many times
Many languages implement $flatMap$ over a collection, offering an alternative for nested loops. The most often cited example is the linked list though, since it can be nicely described in a functional way:  

$List(\mathbb{A}):= Cons(\mathbb{A}) \bigsqcup Nil$  
$Nil: List(())$  
$Cons(\mathbb{A}) := \mathbb{A} \times List(\mathbb{A})$  
$\cdot \mathbin{::}\cdot = (head: \mathbb{A}, tail: List(\mathbb{A})) \Rightarrow Cons(\mathbb{A}) \\\  
= head :: tail \mapsto (head, tail)$  

if you then write:  
`foo`$\mathbin{::}$`bar`$\mathbin{::}$`baz`$\mathbin{::}Nil$


```
type Nil = List<Nothing>
type Cons<A> = {
  head: A
  tail: List<A>
}
type List<A> = Cons<A> | Nil
```

```scala
sealed abstract class List[+A]
case class ::[+A](head: A, tail:List[+A]) extends List[A]
case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% endcodetabs %}



#### Functor -- a relaxed monad
$flatMap:= flatten \circ map$  
associativity of flatmap ==>  
you can collapse the effect ==>
no matter how deep you nest the effect $Maybe$, at the end, you will be left with a value or nothing.
