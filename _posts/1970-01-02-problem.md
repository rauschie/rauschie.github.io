  title: "The Problem"
---

One may choose to look at computer programs as a sequence of instructions, ie some operations carried out on some data.
Since the outcome of any instruction depends on all the other instructions carried out before it, the name of the game soon became finding approaches that let humans reason about the correctness of these instructions - given out by the billions every second on modern hardware. We want to make sure that we do the <i>right operations</i>, on the <i>right data</i>, in the <i>right order</i>.
Functional programming is one of those approaches, and this post tries to give a very high level overview of what it is about.
