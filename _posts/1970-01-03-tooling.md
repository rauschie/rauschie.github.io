  title: "1. The tooling - functions and types"
---

We've been talking about <i>data</i>, <i>operations</i> and <i>chaining</i> instructions - intuitively the concept of a function that one has become familiar with during school years, seems like something that could be of interest here. Let's reiterate what that is and what extremely useful properties it has.

# Sets

$x: \mathbb{z}$ -- Let x be an element of $\mathbb{Z}$.  
$\mathbb{Z}$ is a set. In typed programming languages, expressions are assigned a type. You can think of types as sets. 

{% codetabs %}
{% codetab c %}
```c
int x;
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% codetab scala %}
```scala
val x: Int
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% codetab java %}
```java
Integer x;
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% endcodetabs %}

# Anatomy of a function

They have to do with two kinds of data: the kind they can be applied to, and the kind they spew out. You can describe one like this:

$$f:\mathbb{Z} \Rightarrow \mathbb{Q} = x \mapsto \frac{x}{2}$$

where $f$ is the symbol by which the function is referenced, $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of things $f$ is applicable to, and the expression on the right hand side maps any element $x$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ to exactly one thing of type $\mathbb{Q}$.
$f(x)$ - read: '$f$ of $x$' is then called the image of $x$ under $f$. 
The term $\mathbb{Z} \Rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ denotes the set of functions that map from $\mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$. 
The set of functions is indeed a thing, thus we will encounter functions that operate on other functions, return them, or both. Note that in order for the expression $f(x)$ to make sense, both the symbols $f$ and $x$ have to be unambiguous, the practical implication being that you can't reassign them. //TODO

# Set operators – Algebraic data types
The notion of a function is quite closely coupled to that of a set, you define one in terms of its domain and codomain. Two operations over sets are of fundamental interest: they enable us to clearly define what data our function can access and what shape of data it outputs.

Algebraic data types are the way functional programs model the world and represent state - they are a notion just as fundamental as classes are for OOP. Given some axiomatic types -- think: primitives, they enable you to represent arbitrarily complex data.

## Product type
aka tuple, record, struct

$\mathbb{A}\times\mathbb{B}$
&emsp;– an element from $\mathbb{A}$ $and$ one from $\mathbb{B}$.

A $\mathbb{U}$sername an an $\mathbb{I}$d. $\mathbb{B}$read and $\mathbb{B}$utter. The deeply familiar construct used to bunch up a couple of things that just go together.  If you've ever seen a tuple, struct or even a class (forget methods though --setters especially), you already have a great intuition about what it does. You'd want to use it for all the usual reasons, like grouping data points that don't make sense without each other or outputting multiple values.

{% codetabs %}
{% codetab Typescript %}
```typescript
interface User = {
    email: string,
    id: number,
}
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% codetab rust %}
```rust
struct User{
    email: String,
    id: u64,
}
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% codetab scala %}
```scala
case class User(email: String, id: Long)
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% codetab java %}
```java
record User(String email, Long id){}
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% endcodetabs %}

It gives us a trivial way to extend the capabilities of the function costruct: it is now capable of taking on any finite number of arguments that can be expressed via our type system, as well as outputting structured data. Given:

$\mathbb{U}ser:=\mathbb{S}tring \times \mathbb{L}ong $
//TODO  


### Encoding fun()

For all intents and purposes, you can always substitute an n-ary function  

$f:(x \in \mathbb{A}, y \in \mathbb{B}, ..., i \in \mathbb{I}) \Rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$  

for an unary one, taking a product:  

$f:(\mathbb{A}\times\mathbb{B}\times ... \times \mathbb{I}) \Rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$  

a perhaps bit lesser-known trick is to substitute for a chain of unary functions, each returning an unary function taking the next member of the product:

$f:(\mathbb{A})\Rightarrow(\mathbb{B})\Rightarrow ... \Rightarrow (\mathbb{I}) \Rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$  

you would then apply $f$ like this:

$z:\mathbb{Z} = f(x)(y)...(i)$

The third form is called a Curried function.

## Sum type
aka disjoint union, tagged union, coproduct

$$\mathbb{A}\bigsqcup\mathbb{B}$$, sometimes: $\mathbb{A}+\mathbb{B}$
&emsp;– an element from $\mathbb{A}$ $or$ from $\mathbb{B}$.

{% codetabs %}
{% codetab Typescript %}
```typescript
type Pet = Cat | Dog
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% codetab rust %}
```rust
enum Pet {
    Cat,
    Dog,
}
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% codetab scala %}
```scala
sealed trait Pet
case class Cat() extends Pet
case class Dog() extends Pet
```
{% endcodetab %}
{% endcodetabs %}


### Pattern matching
You have at some point likely encountered something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_function) function:

$f: =
(x : \mathbb{R}) \mapsto
  \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } (x) \in \mathbb{Q} \\\\\
    0 &\text{else}
  \end{cases} $

//TODO ad-hoc polymorphism  


## Key takeaways
 - If you read "Type", think: "Set"
 - If you see "`:`", think: "$\in$"
 - If you read "Product type", think: "$and$", "Struct", "Tuple", even: "Class"
 - If you read "Sum type", think: "$or$", "Enum", "Traits" or whatever construct your language choses to encode this type-level operator with

## Optional reading
### Top-, Bottom- and Unit types
  - Top type ~ a supertype of all types. `Any`.
  - Unit type ~ any singleton type really. Point is, that if it serves as the codomain of a pure function, all the elements of the domain can only map to a single element in the codomain, thus all pure functions mapping a given type to the unit type are equal.
  - Bottom type ~ a subtype of all types. `Nothing`.

### A side note on etymology
The terms "sum-" and "product type" reflect on the observation that the number of elements in the cartesian product and disjoint union, denoted $|\mathbb{A}\times\mathbb{B}|$ and $|\mathbb{A}\bigsqcup\mathbb{B}|$, equals that of 
$|\mathbb{A}| \cdot |\mathbb{B}|$ and $|\mathbb{A}|\ + |\mathbb{B}|$ respectively.  
//TODO verify milewski  
Over some type systems, these operators also work analoguosly to multiplication and addition over a semiring.
Category theory has the concept of a "dual construct", which is then called co-`$CONSTRUCT`, and the disjoint union being the dual of the product in that framework, is termed "coproduct".
