### operator
<ul> //TODO  
a function. Often used as a shorthand for 'binary operator', which takes two things of one type and combines them into a single thing of same type, so they lend themselves well for infix notation. A set being 'closed' under an operation makes intuitive sense then: given only elements of a set and such an operator, you can't express anything</ul>

### isomorph
 - for the current intents and purposes, the same.
 
### type constructor
 - a type with one or more holes that you can plug another types into, like `EventHandler<E>` or `Map<K,V>`. Since it is a type in itself, you can consider it as an encoding of a type level function.

### type level function
  - a function that operates on a given language's types. //TODO
