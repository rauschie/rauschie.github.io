This guide is intended for those who already have some familiarity with writing code and seeks to provide a somewhat comprehensive overview on the essence of functional programming.

It is not meant to teach functional techniques in any specific language, but includes snippets in multiple of them. The intent is to develop the intuition that the constructs discussed here are fundamentally valid independently of language limitations, as well as to help with terminology: many of these are referenced differently depending on whether the exchange is specific to a language.

One of the goals is to provide a path through this tutorial with the least possible amount of meta. I am striving to only introduce notions that "pull their own weight" -- either have direct practical applications, or are directly necessary for those that have direct applications, or provide entry points to topics hat //TODO.
