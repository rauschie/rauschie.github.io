## Function application is referentially transparent
Every occurence of $f(x)$, in any context, always evaluates to the <i>same thing</i>.  In computer science, functions exhibiting this [property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency) are called 'pure', and going forward, as we say 'function', we always mean a pure function. This is in contrast with some similar constructs like methods or procedures, which might have side effects (effectively reassign $x$ or any other value, making it ambiguous), warranting a distinction. You can totally **not** expect two occurences of $raiseSalary(\text{employee})$ to evaluate to the <i>same thing</i>, as opposed to $getId(\text{user})$. Writing programs that don't break referential transparency too badly, and how that makes life easy is an important theme of the following chapters. 

## Functions compose
Given the above $f$ and an arbitrary $g \in (\mathbb{N} \Rightarrow \mathbb{Z})$ there's nothing stopping you from defing $h \in (\mathbb{N} \Rightarrow \mathbb{Q})$ in terms of $f$ and $g$.

$$h:=x \mapsto f(g(x))$$

As long as the domain of $f$ matches the codomain of $g$, it's perfectly fine to say '$f$ of $g$ of $x$' and $h$ is a well-defined symbol.

## Function composition is associative
We can use the following symbol to denote functon composition:

$\displaylines{ \cdot\circ\cdot:(\mathbb{B} \Rightarrow \mathbb{C})\times(\mathbb{A} \Rightarrow \mathbb{B}) \Rightarrow (\mathbb{A} \Rightarrow \mathbb{C}) \\\ =(g \circ f)(x:\mathbb{A}) \mapsto g(f(x)) }$  
//TODO let your programs compose like functions

the operator "$\circ$" (read: "after") is a function over the set of functions. Furthermore, it is an associative one.

That means that the order of application does not matter, the expressions "$(h\mathbin{\text{after}}g)\mathbin{\text{after}}f$" and "$h\mathbin{\text{after}}(g\mathbin{\text{after}}f)$" have the same meaning.

### Pipe
you can also trivially define the well-known $pipe$ operator, often denoted with `|`:

$\cdot \mathbin{pipe} \cdot:(x:\mathbb{A}, f: \mathbb{A} \Rightarrow \mathbb{B}) \Rightarrow \mathbb{B} = x \mathbin{pipe} f \mapsto f(x)$,  
where $\mathbb{B}:=$ the codomain of $f$.  

We like this one a lot, as it helps a great deal with readibility -- the order in which functions are applied now matches their order of appearance in the source code, ie

//TODO do away with db due to async connotation  
$ (getCartContents \circ getUserByEmail \circ getDbHandle)()$    

then becomes: 

```typescript
getDbHandle() | getUserByEmail | getCartContent
```
